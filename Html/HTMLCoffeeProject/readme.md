Again I can open this up in the bigger browser window just so I can see how it looks. We have the logo, We have the heading we have the links then we have a massive background image which technically is not background but eventually it will be. Then we're going to have a featured products and then we have three sections where we have one house blend with a title image and the text we're also going to have a French roast and Colombian and each of them are going to have these details where we can navigate to wikipedia if we have searched for the coffe and Wikipedia. and all the way at the bottom we have our copyright with back to top likn or press the kink and navigate to the top of the page.

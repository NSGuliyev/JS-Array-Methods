    <h1>Garbage Collection</h1>
    <p>The job of this collector is to find the tha variables or constants that are no longer used and
        and then dealocate the memory that was alocated to them earlier. So you as a JavaScrip Developer
        do not have to worry about this. Memory alocation and dealocation automatically happens behind the scenes,
        and you have no control over that. You can not tell Garbage Collector when to run and what variables to 
        remove from memory. So based on some complex algorithms, this Garbage Collector runs in the background,
        it figures out what variables are not used, and then it will automatically dealocate their memory.
